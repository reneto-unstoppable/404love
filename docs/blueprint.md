# **App Name**: Error of the Heart

## Core Features:

- Meme Login: Clean, meme-hinted login/sign-up forms with an anonymous login option that generates a meme-tastic nickname.
- Joke Profiles: Dynamic, silly profile creation with absurd fields, including a fake image generator to make glitched faces.
- AI profile quirks: AI-generated profiles with strange quirks that the system uses as a tool to match and unmatch people.
- Personality Analysis: A personality quiz with nonsensical questions to provide dramatic (and inaccurate) compatibility results.
- Fake Swiping: Tinder-style swiping that always results in a '404 Match Not Found' message with confetti animation and breakup music.
- Chaos Mode: Random pop-up alerts that simulate soulmate buffering and emotional baggage limits.
- Unmatch Roulette: Unmatch Roulette button which instantly unmatches the user from everyone with messages from the spirit vegetable council.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7), drawing inspiration from internet humor and meme culture without being overly cliche. Purple adds an eccentric, tongue-in-cheek element.
- Background color: Very dark purple (#120B1F), almost black, to enhance the dark humor theme and make UI elements stand out.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#3F51B5) to highlight CTAs and interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headlines. Body Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for body text.
- Use glitchy, pixelated icons to add to the chaotic and comedic feel of the app.
- Include chaotic animations for fake matches, profile glitches, and error messages to maintain the playful absurdity.
- Card-based layout for profiles to provide a tinder-esque swiping experience
